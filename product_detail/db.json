The ReWoolÂ® Oversized Shirt Jacket has all the classic shirt detailing-collar, cuffs with buttons, and a shirttail hem, along with two front chest flap pockets and on-seam pockets. The sleeves are fully lined for added warmth and it's made with a GRS-certified recycled Italian Wool and GRS-certified recycled nylon blend. Think cozy, comfy, and oh-so easy to layer. With the goal of increasing the use of recycled materials and reducing the harmful impacts of production, the Global Recycled Standard (GRS) sets requirements for third-party certification of recycled input in products-including chain of custody, social and environmental practices, and chemical restrictions.",
